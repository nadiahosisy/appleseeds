        The problem with the code is that the parent container (#outer) does not
        have a specified positioning property. When you set the child div
        (#inner) to have an absolute position, it will be positioned relative to
        its closest positioned ancestor. In this case, since the parent
        container doesn't have a positioned property set, the child div's
        position will be relative to the initial containing block (usually the
        viewport). To fix the code using the positioning properties we've
        learned, you can add a positioning property to the parent container
        (#outer). By adding position: relative; to the parent container
        (#outer), we establish it as the positioned ancestor for the child div
        (#inner). Now, the child div will be positioned relative to the top left
        corner of the parent container, with its top offset set to 10 pixels.
        This will position the small box on top of the bigger box as intended.
