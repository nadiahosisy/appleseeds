              >Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are
              separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a
              ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has
              been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games
              since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme
              at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of
              volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.
              The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially
              proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally'
              by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it
              with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the
              court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The
              receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their
              court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the
              ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may
              not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first
              two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an
              attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that
              the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and
              continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the
              rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next
              rally. A few of the most common faults include:</span

          <h3>Setter</h3>
          <p>
            The setter is responsible for receiving the ball from the initial
            pass and setting it up for a teammate to attack. They play a crucial
            role in orchestrating the team's offense by making precise and
            strategic passes.

          <h3>Outside Hitter</h3>
          <p>
            Also known as the left-side hitter, the outside hitter is positioned
            on the left side of the net. They are usually the primary attackers
            and play a key role in both serving and blocking. Outside hitters
            need to possess strong hitting and defensive skills.

          <h3>Middle Blocker</h3>
          <p>
            Positioned in the center of the net, the middle blocker plays a
            crucial role in both offense and defense. They are responsible for
            blocking the opponent's attacks, as well as executing quick attacks
            from the center of the net. Middle blockers need to have excellent
            blocking and jumping abilities.
