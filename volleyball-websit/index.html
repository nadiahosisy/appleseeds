          <h3>Setter</h3>
          <p>
            The setter is responsible for receiving the ball from the initial
            pass and setting it up for a teammate to attack. They play a crucial
            role in orchestrating the team's offense by making precise and
            strategic passes.

          <h3>Outside Hitter</h3>
          <p>
            Also known as the left-side hitter, the outside hitter is positioned
            on the left side of the net. They are usually the primary attackers
            and play a key role in both serving and blocking. Outside hitters
            need to possess strong hitting and defensive skills.

          <h3>Middle Blocker</h3>
          <p>
            Positioned in the center of the net, the middle blocker plays a
            crucial role in both offense and defense. They are responsible for
            blocking the opponent's attacks, as well as executing quick attacks
            from the center of the net. Middle blockers need to have excellent
            blocking and jumping abilities.
